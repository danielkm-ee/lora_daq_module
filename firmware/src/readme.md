write your code here

#### structure for our project i'd love to use
put both *.c files and *.h files here, each should be named the same.

ex. say you make a i2c module, title the src and headers i2c.c and i2c.h respectively. this would be the directory with only your new module
../src/
	- i2c.c
	- i2c.h
